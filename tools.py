This file contains some basic functions for the checkers game implementation.
The functions are:
    a. get_moves()
    b. get_jumps()
    c. get_captures()
    d. search_path()
    e. choose_color()
This file also contains two string constants to be used in the main() function.

    This function returns moves for a given single piece at row,col position.
    This function returns a list of valid moves in terms of string positions,
    like 'a1', 'b4' etc. The rules are follows:
        a. All the move(s) must be inside the board.
        b. If the given row, col position has no piece (i.e. empty), this
            function returns an empty list.
        c. If the piece is not a king then it will return a list of at most 
            two diagonal positions. For a black piece, the diagonals will be 
            bottom-left and bottom-right. For a white, they will be top-left

            four diagonal positions. Irrespective of color, the diagonals

    lists all the capture for a single piece on the board located at the row,

    more than one space if they can jump one of the opponent's checker pieces 
    which is located immediately in their diagonal vicinity and onto a free 
    space. This function returns a list of valid captures in terms of string

        b. If the given row, col position has no piece (i.e. empty), this
